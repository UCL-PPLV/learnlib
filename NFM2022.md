# Getting Started

In this codebase we implement the incremental and continuous algorithms, as well as benchmarks on their performance.
A pre-compiled version is avaiable at `distribution/target/bundles/learnlib-0.17.0-SNAPSHOT-fat-tests.jar`.
To recompile it execute:
```
mvn clean package -Pbundles -DskipTests
```

# Running Benchmarks
There are 2 types of benchmarks: MUT (mutations) and FEAT (features).
These can be ran over arbitrarily sized automata, and using arbritary query limits.

To run the benchamrks:
```
java -Xms4g -Xmx8g -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=$NSLOTS -jar ./distribution/target/bundles/learnlib-0.17.0-SNAPSHOT-fat-tests.jar <STATE-SIZE> <MUT|FEAT> <QUERY-LIMIT> <BINARY>
```
Where:
- `<STATE-SIZE>` is the size of the target automaton to be generated.
- `<MUT|FEAT>` is the type of benchmark
- `<QUERY-LIMIT>` is the limit of queries to be used. 
- `<BINARY>` is whether to compute the progress metric in [0, 1] (false) or {0, 1} (true).

Note: Computing with BINARY = true can be expensive in large automata. This is not due to the learning algorithm but due to the metric used in measuring learning process. As such the true option is provided to get faster answers at the expense of sacrifising progress metric granularity. We still do not recommend benchmarking state spaces over 40 on normal machines. The benchmarks referenced in the paper were done in HPC clusters.

The paper benchamrks use the following parameters:
```
10 MUT 10000 true
20 MUT 10000 true
40 MUT 10000 true
80 MUT 10000 true
160 MUT 20000 true
10 FEAT 10000 true
20 FEAT 10000 true
40 FEAT 10000 true
80 FEAT 10000 true
160 FEAT 20000 true
```
